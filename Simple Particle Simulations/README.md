# Simple Particle Simulations

-V1:
Uses purely Pygame and Python to create particles have them modify their velocities in x and y direction in relation to each other, result is a cloud of particles instead of what V2 was supposed to be

-V2:
Uses Pygame and Pymunk libraries and to create a particle simulation with gravity, basically keeps on adding particles interacting with each other until the framerate drops below 60fps
